# Closing Statements in Presidential Debate Between Two Fictional Characters

This project aims to create an interactive Gradio-based chatbot that generates elaborate presidential debates between two fictitious characters running for the USA presidential elections using the OpenAI API. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in utilizing Language Models and understanding their capabilities in generating coherent, contextually relevant, and creative content.
